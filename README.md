## 💾 Data Management

### Data Structure

Each match is stored as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": 1697433600000,
  "team1": "India",
  "team1Score": 156,
  "team1Wickets": 4,
  "team2": "Australia",
  "team2Score": 142,
  "team2Wickets": 6,
  "overs": 18.5,
  "matchStatus": "live",
  "venue": "Melbourne Cricket Ground",
  "timestamp": "16/10/2025, 10:30:00"
}
```

### Storage Key
- **Local Storage Key:** `cricketMatches`
- **Storage Format:** JSON Array
- **Capacity:** ~5-10MB per domain (browser-dependent)

### Data Persistence

- Data survives browser refresh ✅
- Data survives browser restart ✅
- Data persists across sessions ✅
- Clearing browser cache deletes data ⚠️
- Data is not shared across browsers or devices ⚠️
